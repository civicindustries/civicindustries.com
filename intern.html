            <h2>Project Tracks:</h2>

            <h3>URBAN RESEARCH:</h3>

            <p>We’ve learned about urban blight in New Orleans; help us understand how this problem manifests in other cities across the country.
            Help define the industry understanding of this emerging solution space: what tools and strategies are cities currently using to fight blight in their communities? Who are the major community and non-profit players? </p>


            <h3>DESIGN:</h3>

            <p>Make your visual mark on our product and brand: flex your creative muscles and come away with portfolio samples being used by a real-world civic startup.</p>
            <p>Test and iterate your designs with real users: learn how your work influences user experience and behavior.</p>


            <h3>CIVIC HACKING:</h3>

            <p>Make data about vacant properties useful and actionable: play an active role in the conception and buildout of mapping and visualization tools.</p>
            <p>BlightStatus depends on access to live City data; help us design and build the API that makes it all possible.</p>

            <h4>Main Description:</h4>
            <p>Civic Industries is a new civic startup that helps governments and community leaders make data-driven decisions to improve their communities, and we are seeking interns with the skills to tackle big challenges on a short timeline. Trust us, this isn’t your typical internship: you’ll have one or more core projects which you’ll lead with autonomy, creative freedom, and responsibility - lots of it. Plus, you’ll get to work with a small, passionate, and experienced team that’ll rely on you to have an impact. By the end of the internship, you’ll walk away with not only a new network of industry and civic leaders, but also with a finished product to point to and say, “I did that.”</p>

            <h4>About us:</h4>
            <p>As former Code for America fellows, Civic Industries’ three co-founders have spent over a year building BlightStatus, a web application that leverages the power of open data to accelerate the efforts of cities and citizen-activists to bring abandoned and blighted properties back into productive use. We’ve put it to use for the City of New Orleans, to major acclaim; now we need your help to make this tool useful and available to cities across the country.</p>

            <h4>About you:</h4>

            <p>You’re an urbanist, design junkie, data scientist, policy wonk, visual storyteller, and/or civic technologist who has the skills and drive to tackle big projects on a short timeline.</p>
            <p>You are driven, inquisitive, and entrepreneurial; communicate effectively; and care deeply about civic life and how technology can enhance it.</p>
            <p>Civic hackers will have experience with Ruby &amp; Javascript, and ideally have the github repos to prove it; experience with test-driven development is a big plus.</p>
            <p>Designers will know their way around Adobe Creative Suite (particularly Photoshop, Illustrator, and/or Fireworks); the ability to implement web designs in HTML &amp; CSS is a major plus.</p>


            <h4>About the internship:</h4>

            <p>Spend 10-20 hours a week leading one or more core projects in line with your area of interest.</p>
            <p>Work remotely, or at the fantastic Code for America HQ in the SoMa district of San Francisco, a hotbed for civic tech startups and friendly, smart people.</p>
            <p>Work directly with the co-founders, and gain access to an unprecedented network of industry and civic leaders.</p>
            <p>Have a direct influence on the future of a product that’s solving real civic problems.</p>
            <p>Earn school credit and/or a modest stipend.</p>


            <p>We kept this form short for a reason: talk is cheap. We want to see what you can do, so point us with links to your past work, your portfolio, or your code repository. Have skills to offer that may not fit into one of the three tracks? Our minds are open: we want to hear from you!</p>
